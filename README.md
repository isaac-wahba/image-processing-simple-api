# Image Processing Simple API

In This Project, I've applied NodeJs with Express, and TypeScript core concepts
Testing has been done with Jasmine.

## To Start The App:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm run start`
* run the tests with `test`

## API call example:

* call the api through : `http://localhost:3000/api/image?width=300&height=50&fileName=fjord.jpg`
* Feel free to change the width & height, and to choose any included photo in the images/original directory.




## Description (By Udacity):
an API that can be used in two different ways. As a simple placeholder API, the first allows you to place images into your frontend with the size set via URL parameters (and additional stylization if you choose) for rapid prototyping. The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of your images to the front end to reduce page load size. Rather than needing to resize and upload multiple copies of the same image to be used throughout your site, the API you create will handle resizing and serving stored images for you.
